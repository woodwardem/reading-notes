HTML has inline and block elements. 
Inline elements only take up space surrounded /bounded with tags that define elements. Inline elements do not break the flow of the content/code. 
For example, a <span> tag does not break up the flow of the whole paragraph even though its inside a <div> tag paragraph. 
When you change the <span> tag to a <p> tag that code inside the <p> tag will take up a whole line cause it is a block element. 
Here are some inline elements
-<a>
-<abbr>
<b>
<bdi>
<i>
<iframe>
<input>
<img>
And there are some many more!
