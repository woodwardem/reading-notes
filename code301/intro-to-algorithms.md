# ✍️ Notes

How to Solve a Coding Challenge:

1. Research that week's method or concept. 
*What method or concept are we learning about this week?
*Look it up on MDN or W3schools
*Search for articles on Medium about the method/topic
*Watch a Youtube video
*Review your lecture notes from class
*Participate in discussions with other developers about the challenge
2. Understand the problem.
-Read through the problem
-identify suggestive key words/hints
-identify the requiremnts for solving the challenge
-indentify the inputs
-(inputs are the arguments our function will take in when its called)
-identify the outputs 
-outputs are what we are expecting our function to return when it finishes running
-view the test for input/output examples
3. Create a step-by-step plan (algorithm) for how you'll solve it.
-think how this week's method/topic can be applied to solve the code challenge.
-create a visual example with inputs (whiteboard) to help wrap your brain around each step your function is taking.
-create a checklist of things the function needs to accomplish
-focus on input/output in your visual
-You should consider the steps that your algorithm will take to use the input and move towards output. 
4. Carry out the plan and write acctual code. 
-using your algorithm checklist, write code that will accomplish one task at a time. 
-complete your function
-correct any syntax/ linter errors.
-don't forget to return your solution!
-get the test to pass.
5. Look Back and possibly refactor your solution if it could be better.
-Is the test for this code challenge passing?
-Does your solution meet all the requirments for this code challenge?
-Does your solution use this week's method/topicto solve the code challenge.
-Can you understand it at a glance? Does it make sense? Is it readable?
-Can you think of other ways to refactor? Make it a one liner?
-How have other people solved this problem?
